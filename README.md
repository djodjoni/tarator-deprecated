tarator
=======
This is deprecated since Espresso 2 is out and included in android test packages.
The NEW tarator library (https://github.com/djodjoni/tarator) is used now for Cucumber and Espresso integration
=======

Android test framework.

This is a fork of Espresso android-test-kit: http://code.google.com/p/android-test-kit/wiki/Espresso (imho currently the best tool available)

Tarator is using Gradle to build and also aims to improve and extend already quite stable core of Espresso.
